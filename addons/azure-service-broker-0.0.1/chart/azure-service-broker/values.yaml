## Whether to register this broker with the Kubernetes Service Catalog. If true,
## the Kubernetes Service Catalog must already be installed on the cluster.
## Marking this option false is useful for scenarios wherein one wishes to host
## the broker in a separate cluster than the Service Catalog (or other client)
## that will access it.
registerBroker: true

service:
  ## Type of service; valid values are "ClusterIP", "LoadBalancer", and
  ## "NodePort". "ClusterIP" is sufficient in the average case where a service
  ## catalog installation in the same cluster is the only client that needs to
  ## communicate with this broker. i.e. The broker does not need to receive
  ## inbound requests from outside the cluster.
  type: ClusterIP
  ## Further configuration if service is of type "NodePort"
  nodePort:
    ## Available port in allowable range (e.g. 30000 - 32767 on minikube)
    port: 30080

# Secret name where azure credentials are keep
# like "subscriptionId", "tenantId", "clientId", "clientSecret"

  ## Valid values are "AzurePublicCloud" and "AzureChinaCloud"

## Minimum stability required for a module's services and plans to be listed

  ## If not embedded, specifies whether to use a secure connection to the
  ## remote Redis host
  enableTls: true

  ## Used to introduce a unique identifier to enable multiple OSBA instances
  ## to share one redis. If nothing is provided here, no additional identifier
