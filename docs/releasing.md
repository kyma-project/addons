This document describes how the release flow looks like and how to create a bundle release.

## Release process

Every change in the master branch which passes all checks triggers creating a `latest` tag and release.

Every tag pushed to the repository triggers a new release. If the tag name matches the `x.y.0` version pattern, in which `0` is revision, Travis CI build creates a release tag named `release-x.y`.

## Create a release from the master branch

Follow these steps to create a new bundle release 0.6.0:

1. Checkout the master branch with the latest changes:

    ```
    git checkout master
    git pull
    ```

2. Create a tag with the proper release version:

    ```
    git tag 0.6.0
    ```   

3. Push the tag:

    ```
    git push {remote} 0.6.0 
    ```
    
    >**NOTE:** For example, if you want to push the tag to the upstream, run the following command:
    >```
    >git push upstream 0.6.0 
    >```
    

4. After Travis CI jobs finish, go to the **releases** tab and the **branches**. There you can find a new release and a new release branch.
 
## Create a release from the release branch

Follow these steps to create a new bundle release 0.6.1:

1. Checkout a release branch with the latest changes. For example:

    ```
    git fetch {remote}
    git checkout release-0.6
    git pull
    ```

2. Create a tag with the proper release version. For example:

    ```
    git tag 0.6.1
    ```   

3. Push the tag:

    ```
    git push {remote} 0.6.1 
    ```

4. After Travis CI jobs finish, go to the **releases** tab. There you can find a new `0.6.1` release.
