# Redis

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an advanced key-value cache and store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps and hyperloglogs.

For more information on the Redis chart, see [this](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/redis) document.
