# Bundles

## Overview

This repository contains bundles which the Helm Broker uses. It allows you to choose a set of bundles and configure the Helm Broker. You can also define your own bundles.

## Usage

The `bundles` folder contains subfolders with sources of complete bundle repositories. A bundle repository is available in GitHub Pages under the `https://kyma-project.github.io/bundles/{FOLDER NAME}/` URL. Any change of the `master` branch triggers CI which is updating bundle repositories by generating necessary tgz files. The `bundles` repository contains the following sets of bundles (bundle repositories):
 * stable - the default bundle repository used in Kyma Helm Broker, accessible under the `https://kyma-project.github.io/bundles/stable/` URL.
 * showcase - sets of bundles with Kyma show cases, accessible under the `https://kyma-project.github.io/bundles/showcase/` URL.

If you want to configure the Helm Broker to use different set of bundles, read the [Helm Broker configuration](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/master/docs/service-brokers/docs/011-configuration-helm-broker.md) and configure the proper URL.
